# SymptoTracker

Sympto-Tracker is a Machine Learning Web Application that allows users to predict the likelihood of a diagnosis of certain diseases with the help of symptoms and the
patient's medical record or patient scan report. 

For predicting the disease diagnosis we used Supervised Binary classification Machine Learning models, and used the following algorithms:

* `Logistic Regression`
* `Support Vector Machine`
* `XGBoost`

The application is built using React, Python, Flask, and RStudio, and currently supports the prediction of the following diseases:

* `Mesothelioma`
* `Liver Cirrhosis`
* `Chronic Kidney Disease`
* `Coronary Heart Disease`
* `Diabetes Mellitus`

# Tech Stack

* `RStudio`  -> Data Analysis and Visualization
* `React.js` -> Frontend Web Framework
* `Python`   -> Machine Learning Models
* `Flask`    -> Backend Web Framework
